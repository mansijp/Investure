# Investure
Investure, investing in the future, bridges the gap between green startups looking for funding and big corporations looking to improve their CSR. How does Investure work? Using our platform, green start-ups will get donations from corporations and grants from the government. The government will match corporate donations under 50k to the green startups. When corporations donate through our platform, they will get tax write-offs, a right to invest in the startup, and a right to be its first customer. For every donation made we will receive 1%.York U will be the credible medium through which we communicate with the government for grants and communicate with other startups and corporations.
